## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

Males are more likely to utilize citibikes than females. Additionally subscribers are more likely to utilize citibikes for commuting during weekday AM and PM hours, where as customers are more likely to use citibikes on the weekends. 


- Based on results by gender, we should target female markets more. 

- Figure out why ridership on Wednesday evenings is lighter than other days. 

- Create a visualization to look at trip duration by gender to see if there are significant differences in length between users. 

- Create a visualization at starting and ending locations by gender to see if one gender is more likely to utilize scooters for commuting.
